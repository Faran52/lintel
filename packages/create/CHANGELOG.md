# Changelog

## 1.1.0

### Added

- A state store answer, resolved per target: Zustand for React, Next.js and React Native,
  `@ngrx/signals` for Angular, and Pinia for Vue, whose `--pinia` flag now follows the answer
  instead of always being passed. Solid and Svelte are never asked: their stores ship inside the
  framework, and the repo-structure rules now say so.
- A Tailwind answer now also wires class linting: `eslint-plugin-better-tailwindcss` joins the
  toolchain and the emitted config loads the `tailwind` layer.
- The shipped test setup grew real content: TanStack Query test defaults when that library is
  chosen, and inert `useNavigate` stand-ins for react-router and TanStack Router on the targets
  that could adopt them. The file is preserved on sync, since projects add their own mocks to it.
- React Native projects get a real `build`: `expo export --platform web`, made possible by moving
  the route-directory starter tests out of `src/app/`, where expo-router treated them as routes.

### Changed

- TypeScript only. The language question is gone, every scaffolder is invoked with its TypeScript
  flags, and running against a project that recorded `typescript: false` refuses with a clear
  message rather than silently converting it.
- The filename policy was rebuilt per framework: components may be anything but camelCase, tests
  and specs follow the file they cover instead of carrying a rule of their own, declaration files
  take kebab-case or camelCase, Angular is kebab-case throughout, and router-owned directories
  are exempt from the script rule.
- The pre-commit hook pins its lint-staged config, so a nested config file can no longer hijack
  staged files in a monorepo.

## 1.0.4

First published release.

### Added

- Scaffold any of eight targets with the framework's own official generator, then apply the
  shared standard on top: ESLint config, tsconfig, stylelint, git hooks, test setup and agent
  rules. Targets: React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, Solid, Angular, React Native through Expo, and
  Manifest V3 browser extensions.
- `@linteljs/create sync` re-applies the files that cannot arrive through an npm update. It shows a
  diff first and never overwrites a file you edited.
- A `typeSafety` answer that picks the banned-pattern floor: `strict` bans every escape hatch,
  while `relaxed` allows a double cast and `eslint-disable` and ships a `CustomTypes` helper for
  common payload shapes.
